I have unpacked this with my [VBA-IDE-Code-Export](https://github.com/spences10/VBA-IDE-Code-Export) tool, if you want to have the binary go to the releases and download it from [there](https://github.com/spences10/pacellman/releases/tag/1.0.0).

This was made in Microsoft Excel 2003, an awesome achievement! 

There is a link to what appears to be called [VBA Action game](http://www1.plala.or.jp/chikada/index.htm) 

Heres a pic of the site:

I lay no claim to this, I have found this on an old external hard drive from an old job back in 2007, this is not my content if you are the owner and you do not want this being shared then I will respect your wishes  

Thank you mysterious contributor from the past :+1:
